## Executive Summary

According to a recent article in the U.S. News and World Report (https://www.usnews.com/info/blogs/press-room/articles/2016-05-17/the-us-news-raytheon-stem-index-shows-america-will-have-to-depend-on-foreign-workers-to-fill-stem-jobs), there were over 230,000 new Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) jobs created in the United States between 2014-2015 compared to almost 39,000 new graduates - a 13% difference.  If current trends continue, there will be nearly 1.1 million unfilled jobs by 2024 (http://www.talentwave.com/the-shortage-of-stem-workers-in-the-us/).

## Business Objectives

The objectives of the project are to create a platform for testing, training and continued development of software engineers and developers.  One of the primary goals is to have a self-sustaining site where content cobtributions are made by a community of developers of all levels.  Content is monitored and approved for both appropriate content and language as well as selected experts.  Skill levels are tested through exams and coding exercises.  The intent is to test users on the full life-cycle development, including requirements definition, market analysis, project planning and software estimation, testing and bug tracking.  Existing systems and tools will be used whenever possible based on established criteria. the number of  and Almost any software developer is by  that will be independent of the system they are . 
*Business objectives should offer the details for why the project is important.  Outline the goals of the project int he sense of the value it will bring and set expectations.  Keep your objectives measurable to avoid confusion in whether or not they have been met.*

## Background

*Provide any relevant background information regarding why this project is being initiated*

## Scope

*The Scope section should outline what is and is not included as part of this project.  Oftentimes we make assumptions of features or functionality that is not necessarily required.  This is especially useful in a phased approach or when working on an existing system.*

## Functional requirements

*This is where most of the detail should reside.  describe all of the required capabilities of the system in detail.  It is helpful to articulate features in terms of user capabilities.  Keep in mind that the features will be designed and developed off of these descriptions, so if you leave anything up to interpretation, you run the risk of the results not meeting your expectations.  You can also assume capabilities that are not mentioned here will not be included in the project, no matter how common or obvious they are.  You may want to break our subsections for each major feature to make the document more organized.*


## Personnel requirements

*In this section you may want to describe the composition of the team, do you need dedicated development?  how many people?  How about design or QA?  Think about what personnel is required to make this project a success, and place your recommendations here.*

## Delivery schedule

*It's often helpful to break a project out into phases or milestones.  In this section list out any logical checkpoints where you would like to see the project demonstrated to ensure that expectations are being met.  Describe the phase, and the functional requirements required for completion.*

## Other requirements

*This section serves as a catch-all for any details that may not fit in other areas.  things like device or browser support, considerations for accessibility or inspiration for style.  Offer additional context here to ensure the project meets your vision*

## Assumptions

*Oftentimes we are reliant on outside sources such as frameworks to be used, or services that our system will depend on.  In this section you should provide detail on any assumptions that you have made, such as the system being reliant on the availability of the Google Maps API.*

## Limitations

*Identify any limitations in terms of time, personnel, technical details, or other things that limit the scope, time, and cost of the project being discussed.*

## Risks

*Every project has inherent risks that may cause delay or even failure of a project.  You must identify this risks to show you know what they are, and also identify ways in which you would mitigate those risks.*
